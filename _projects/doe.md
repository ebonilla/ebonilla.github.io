This covers a broad set of methods and applications in which we wish to optimise an experiment, or a sequence of experiments, to achieve a specific goal. For example, (1) be maximally informative about some factor of interest (traditional design of experiments); (2) do model selection or (3) maximise some other quantity of interest (Bayesian optimization). We have championed ground-breaking advancements in adaptive and efficient design space sampling, crucial for optimizing specific objectives, notably entropy-based ones. 

While these methods have clear implications for manufacturing and synthetic biology, their profound impact extends to fields like material design and drug development. We have introduced pioneering methods in optimal sequential design of experiments, as documented in our work presented at ICML 2022 {% cite blau2022optimizing %}.  Furthermore, we have offered a transformative take on Bayesian optimization, recasting the problem as a probabilistic classification task {% cite tiao2021bore %}. This innovative viewpoint enables the application of modern probabilistic classifiers, such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformer-based models. The outcome is a leap in model expressiveness, versatility, and scalability.
